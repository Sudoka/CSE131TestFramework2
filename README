Place the entire dir "CSE131TestFramework2" inside your compiler folder. (ie: if your project is in Workspace/compilerProject, place is in Workspace/compilerProject/)

Name your current RC.sh to RC.sh.backup with mv RC.sh RC.sh.backup

move the RC.sh file inside of CSE131TestFramewprk into your project (following ie above: cp CSE131TestFrameWork/RC.sh .)

note: make sure your RC.sh is in the top level directory and not in some subdirectory like bin/ or src/

Place your own test files into CSE131TestFramework/PhaseX
Run with ./CSE131TestFramework/testAll.sh [phaseX]
Compare the diff's

test.rc -> test file being tested

test.ans.out -> answer file being diffed against

test.my.out -> there are 3 different my.out's that can be created depending on if there was an error during certain phases of running the test -> failure in generating asm file, failure in linking, or failure in correct output

To add to test's, create your own test file, run ./testAll.sh and email yixinzhu91@gmail.com with a zip of your test.rc and your test.ans.out
-> when you create a new test.rc, the output of your file will become the ans.out so send both to me so I can diff with mine and we can resolve any problems before posting to everyone

To run current tests, just download/clone the tests, run ./testAll.sh and check the diffs. Email me if the answers are wrong and you think your compiler is outputting the correct output so we can resolve the problem and upload the correct answers for everyone else.

DISCLAIMER: the "answer" file MAY be wrong, so if there is an error make sure to check the ans.out, your my.out and the test.rc to make sure it really is wrong.

TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE:
make sure all the .class and .java files are in the same directory as the framework folder itself
(so NO src/ and bin/ folders)

ie: in your project folder (mine is: compiler-construction/) should contain:
compiler-construction/*.class //all .class files from bin/
compiler-construction/*.java //all .java files from src
compiler-construction/CSE131TestFramework2/ //this framework

make sure the RC.sh is copied from compiler-construction/CSE131TestFramework2/RC.sh into the top level ie: compiler-construction/

**** make sure input.c and output.s is under compiler-construction/ ****

make sure you re-compiler with make new before cd-ing into CSE131TestFramework2 and then running ./testAll.sh if you are scp-ing from your local machine onto ieng9


-if you have satisfied all those above try running a sample test file manually

so in compiler-construction/ run these commands:

make new
RC (some test file).rc
make compile
a.out


if that works and there is still a problem with the script please email me at yixinzhu91@gmail.com
